# Magic Mirror
A 'Magic Mirror' created for my final year dissertation project.

This was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a small bit of Python. The mirror uses Electron as it's framework and is run on a Raspberry Pi. The project was built based on a specific client brief.

The project involved time management, personal assessment, testing, agile methodologies and design and development. As well as this, I had to teach myself every language required 
to make the mirror and, as a consequence, found a passion for front end development as I am both a very creative individual and have a love of technology.
